      <h2>Preferred Charities</h2>
      <p>
        Key Club International has three preferred charities. We work with these
        charities to raise awareness and fundraising about various issues that
        are plaguing our world today. The three charities are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>• Children's Miracle Network</li>
        <li>• March of Dimes</li>
        <li>• UNICEF</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Children's Miracle Network</h2>
      <p>
        Nonprofit organization that raises funds to aid hospitalized children
        across North America. Money raised for and by the organization is
        dispersed to affiliate Hospitals affiliated with Children’s Miracle
        Network, the purchasing of up-to-date equipment, the implementation of
        outreach programs, and medical research, and community awareness of
        children’s health issues. Like a miracle, CMN provides health care for
        children whose parents cannot afford to pay for medical care.
      </p>
      <h2>March of Dimes</h2>
      <p>
        A foundation that works tirelessly to improve the health of premature
        babies. Funds donated to the foundation go towards birth defect
        prevention research. According the CDC, an estimated 120,000 infants in
        the U.S are born with major structural birth defects each year. Birth
        defects are the leading cause of infant mortality and 70% of the cause
        of these birth defects are unknown. The funds raised by the March of
        Dimes Foundation funds research projects to treat and even prevent
        premature birth defects. The foundation was founded by the 32nd US
        President, Franklin D. Roosevelt in his fight against polio. After
        successfully discovering a vaccine for polio, March of Dimes migrated
        their focus on premature birth research and awareness. Key Club Members
        can support the March of Dimes Foundation by raising premature birth
        awareness by hosting a multitude of programs through November for
        Prematurity Awareness Month, participating in the March for Babies in
        the spring, even simply wearing purple (Premature Awareness Color). This
        is especially prevalent on November 17, Prematurity Awareness Day.
      </p>
      <h2>UNICEF</h2>
      <p>
        For 5 years, the New Jersey District of Key Club International has
        partnered with UNICEF (United Nations Children’s Fund) for the Eliminate
        Project in their fight against Maternal Neonatal Tetanus, a disease that
        claims the lives of dozens of mothers and their infants every second of
        every day. As a result of the generosity of K-Families all over the
        globe, the Eliminate Project has eliminated this deadly virus from 44
        countries. For only $1.80 one vaccine can end the pain and suffering
        from a mother and all of her future children. Recently one more nation,
        the Philippines, has won the fight against MNT!
      </p>
      <h1 className='mb-6'>Other Service Partners</h1>
      <h2>Thirst Project</h2>
      <p>
        Key Club officially teamed up with the Thirst Project! The Thirst
        Project is a movement of thousands of students who have joined the fight
        against the global water crisis. By providing a community with safe
        drinking water, disease rates can drop by up to 88% virtually overnight!
        Look forward to hearing more about the Thirst Project at District
        Convention 2019 at the informative service fair!
      </p>
      <h2>United States Army</h2>
      <p>
        The United States Army is an organization originally created to help the
        unified colonies fight Great Britain in 1775, but is now used as one of
        the main forms of protection for the United States. As Key Clubbers, we
        have chosen to support this cause because of the protection and
        sacrifices the US Army as a whole has given for us. As the largest of
        the three military departments of the Department of Defense in the
        United States, the Army serves "to fight and win our Nation's wars, by
        providing prompt, sustained, land dominance, across the full range of
        military operations and the spectrum of conflict, in support of
        combatant commanders." The service participates in conflicts worldwide
        and is the major ground-based offensive and defensive force. As an
        organization with millions of volunteers that are willing to risk their
        life for our protection, the US Army rightfully deserves our support
        both inside and outside of Key Club!
      </p>
      <h2>Landscape Structures</h2>
      <p>
        Since its conception in 1971 through the efforts of Steve and Barb King,
        Landscape Structures has been committed to improving the lives of
        children for 47 years. Their mission is to enhance the lives of children
        by “fostering and creating inspiring play experiences,” and they do just
        that by creating innovative, strategically-designed playgrounds for all
        ages and children. Playgrounds aren’t just for fun, however -- they
        serve as great community gathering spots. Kiwanis International is proud
        to partner with an organization committed to great fun, as well as
        community building, and we encourage you to learn more about Landscape
        Structures to see how you can build a playground in your own community.
